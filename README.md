# Cost Splitting App
Simple Vue app that calculates who owes what when splitting costs between friends when everyone paid a different amount.  This is the first of ten simple Vue apps I am building over the course of the next year to learn Vue.js.

## To Do
- [X] Create Person
  - [X] Name and amount spent entry
  - [X] Person is added to list when created
- [X] Person List
  - [X] Displays all added people
  - [X] Displays name, spent, and amount owed
  - [X] Ability to delete person that has already been added
  - [X] Ability to edit a person that has already been added
  - [X] Ability to sort the list by amount owed
  - [X] Store list in local storage so it persists
  - [X] Ability to reset list
- [X] Keep track of the total cost being split
- [X] Deploy in a public place.

#### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Ability to export the list
- [ ] Ability to import a list
- [ ] Ability to generate a payment plan
- [ ] Recognize when a duplicate name has been entered and add to existing person
- [X] Make it look real nice on desktop and mobile
